abstract = {In order to measure and assess the quality of GIS, there exist a sparse offer of tools, providing specific functions with their own interest but are not sufficient to deal with broader user's requirements. Interoperability of these tools remains a technical challenge because of the heterogeneity of their models and access patterns. On the other side, quality analysts require more and more integration facilities that allow them to consolidate and aggregate multiple quality measures acquired from different observations or data sources, in using/combining seamlessly different quality tools. Clearly, there is a gap between users's requirements and the spatial data quality market. This demo paper will illustrate GQBox, a geographic quality (tool)box. GQBox supplies a standards-based generic meta model that supports the definition of quality goals and metrics, and it provides a service-based infrastructure that allows interoperability among several quality tools.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach for social and personalized query expansion using social structures in the Web 2.0. While focusing on social tagging systems, the proposed approach considers (i) the semantic similarity between tags composing a query, (ii) a social proximity between the query and the user profile, and (iii) on the fly, a strategy for expanding user queries. The proposed approach has been evaluated using a large dataset crawled from del.icio.us.},

abstract={There is currently a number of interesting research works performed in the area of bridging the gap between Social Networks and Information Retrieval (IR). This is mainly done by enhancing the IR process with social information. Hence, many approaches have been proposed to improve the ranking process by personalizing it using social features. In this paper, we review some of these ranking functions.},
