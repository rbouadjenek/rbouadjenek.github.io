abstract = {In order to measure and assess the quality of GIS, there exist a sparse offer of tools, providing specific functions with their own interest but are not sufficient to deal with broader user's requirements. Interoperability of these tools remains a technical challenge because of the heterogeneity of their models and access patterns. On the other side, quality analysts require more and more integration facilities that allow them to consolidate and aggregate multiple quality measures acquired from different observations or data sources, in using/combining seamlessly different quality tools. Clearly, there is a gap between users's requirements and the spatial data quality market. This demo paper will illustrate GQBox, a geographic quality (tool)box. GQBox supplies a standards-based generic meta model that supports the definition of quality goals and metrics, and it provides a service-based infrastructure that allows interoperability among several quality tools.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach for social and personalized query expansion using social structures in the Web 2.0. While focusing on social tagging systems, the proposed approach considers (i) the semantic similarity between tags composing a query, (ii) a social proximity between the query and the user profile, and (iii) on the fly, a strategy for expanding user queries. The proposed approach has been evaluated using a large dataset crawled from del.icio.us.},

abstract = {We present in this paper a contribution to IR modeling by proposing a new ranking function called SoPRa that considers the social dimension of the Web. This social dimension is any social information that surrounds documents along with the social context of users. Currently, our approach relies on folksonomies for extracting these social contexts, but it can be extended to use any social meta-data, e.g. comments, ratings, tweets, etc. The evaluation performed on our approach shows its benefits for personalized search.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce LAICOS, a social Web search engine as a contribution to the growing area of Social Information Retrieval (SIR). Social information and personalization are at the heart of LAICOS. On the one hand, the social context of documents is added as a layer to their textual content traditionally used for indexing to provide Personalized Social Document Representations. On the other hand, the social context of users is used for the query expansion process using the Personalized Social Query Expansion framework (PSQE) proposed in our earlier works. We describe the different components of the system while relying on social bookmarking systems as a source of social information for personalizing and enhancing the IR process. We show how the internal structure of indexes as well as the query expansion process operated using social information.},

abstract = {Patents are used by legal entities to legally protect their inventions and represent a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation. In 2014, 326,033 patent applications were approved in the US alone -- a number that has doubled in the past 15 years and which makes prior art search a daunting, but necessary task in the patent application process. In this work, we seek to investigate the efficacy of prior art search strategies from the perspective of the inventor who wishes to assess the patentability of their ideas prior to writing a full application. While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior art for complete patent applications, less of this work has focused on patent search with queries representing partial applications. In the (partial) patent search setting, a query is often much longer than in other standard IR tasks, e.g., the description section may contain hundreds or even thousands of words. While the length of such queries may suggest query reduction strategies to remove irrelevant terms, intentional obfuscation and general language used in patents suggests that it may help to expand queries with additionally relevant terms. To assess the trade-offs among all of these pre-application prior art search strategies, we comparatively evaluate a variety of partial application search and query reformulation methods. Among numerous findings, querying with a full description, perhaps in conjunction with generic (non-patent specific) query reduction methods, is recommended for best performance. However, we also find that querying with an abstract represents the best trade-off in terms of writing effort vs. retrieval efficacy (i.e., querying with the description sections only lead to marginal improvements) and that for such relatively short queries, generic query expansion methods help.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the influence of term selection on retrieval performance on the CLEF-IP prior art test collection, using the Description section of the patent query with Language Model (LM) and BM25 scoring functions. We find that an oracular relevance feedback system that extracts terms from the judged relevant documents far outperforms the baseline and performs twice as well on MAP as the best competitor in CLEF-IP 2010. We find a very clear term selection value threshold for use when choosing terms. We also noticed that most of the useful feedback terms are actually present in the original query and hypothesized that the baseline system could be substantially improved by removing negative query terms. We tried four simple automated approaches to identify negative terms for query reduction but we were unable to notably improve on the baseline performance with any of them. However, we show that a simple, minimal interactive relevance feedback approach where terms are selected from only the first retrieved relevant document outperforms the best result from CLEF-IP 2010 suggesting the promise of interactive methods for term selection in patent prior art search.},
