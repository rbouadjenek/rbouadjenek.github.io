	abstract     = {In order to measure and assess the quality of GIS, there exist a sparse offer of tools, providing specific functions with their own interest but are not sufficient to deal with broader user's requirements. Interoperability of these tools remains a technical challenge because of the heterogeneity of their models and access patterns. On the other side, quality analysts require more and more integration facilities that allow them to consolidate and aggregate multiple quality measures acquired from different observations or data sources, in using/combining seamlessly different quality tools. Clearly, there is a gap between users's requirements and the spatial data quality market. This demo paper will illustrate GQBox, a geographic quality (tool)box. GQBox supplies a standards-based generic meta model that supports the definition of quality goals and metrics, and it provides a service-based infrastructure that allows interoperability among several quality tools.},

	abstract     = {Patents are used by legal entities to legally protect their inventions and represent a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation. In 2014, 326,033 patent applications were approved in the US alone -- a number that has doubled in the past 15 years and which makes prior art search a daunting, but necessary task in the patent application process. In this work, we seek to investigate the efficacy of prior art search strategies from the perspective of the inventor who wishes to assess the patentability of their ideas prior to writing a full application. While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior art for complete patent applications, less of this work has focused on patent search with queries representing partial applications. In the (partial) patent search setting, a query is often much longer than in other standard IR tasks, e.g., the description section may contain hundreds or even thousands of words. While the length of such queries may suggest query reduction strategies to remove irrelevant terms, intentional obfuscation and general language used in patents suggests that it may help to expand queries with additionally relevant terms. To assess the trade-offs among all of these pre-application prior art search strategies, we comparatively evaluate a variety of partial application search and query reformulation methods. Among numerous findings, querying with a full description, perhaps in conjunction with generic (non-patent specific) query reduction methods, is recommended for best performance. However, we also find that querying with an abstract represents the best trade-off in terms of writing effort vs. retrieval efficacy (i.e., querying with the description sections only lead to marginal improvements) and that for such relatively short queries, generic query expansion methods help.},

We find a very clear term selection value threshold for use when choosing terms. We also noticed that most of the useful feedback terms are actually present in the original query and hypothesized that the baseline system could be substantially improved by removing negative query terms. We tried four simple automated approaches to identify negative terms for query reduction but we were unable to notably improve on the baseline performance with any of them. However, we show that a simple, minimal interactive relevance feedback approach where terms are selected from only the first retrieved relevant document outperforms the best result from CLEF-IP 2010 suggesting the promise of interactive methods for term selection in patent prior art search.},

The main question one might ask is What would be the benefits of using social information (no matter whether it is content or structure) into the information retrieval process and how is this currently done? With the growing number of efforts towards the combination of IR and social networks, it is necessary to build a clearer picture of the domain and synthesize the efforts in a structured and meaningful way. This paper reviews different efforts in this domain. It intends to provide a clear understanding of the issues as well as a clear structure of the contributions. More precisely, we propose (i) to review some of the most important contributions in this domain to understand the principles of SIR, (ii) a taxonomy to categorize these contributions, and finally, (iii) an analysis of some of these contributions and tools with respect to several criteria, which we believe are crucial to design an effective SIR approach. This paper is expected to serve researchers and practitioners as a reference to help them structuring the domain, position themselves and, ultimately, help them to propose new contributions or improve existing ones.},

The proposed approach relies on matrix factorization to compute the PerSaDoR of documents that match a query, at query time. The complexity analysis shows that our approach scales linearly with the number of documents that match the query, and thus, it can scale to very large datasets.

	abstract     = {In the context of the bioCADDIE challenge addressing information retrieval of biomedical datasets, we propose a method for retrieval of biomedical data sets with heterogenous schemas through query reformulation. In particular, the method proposed transforms the initial query into a multi-field query that is then enriched with terms that are likely to occur in the relevant datasets. We compare and evaluate two query expansion strategies, one based on the Rocchio method and another based on a biomedical lexicon. We then perform a comprehensive comparative evaluation of our method on the bioCADDIE dataset collection for biomedical retrieval. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-field query method compared to two baselines, with MAP improved from 0.2171 and 0.2669 to 0.2996. We also show the benefits of query expansion, where the Rocchio expanstion method improves the MAP for our two baselines from 0.2171 and 0.2669 to 0.335. We show that the Rocchio query expansion method slightly outperforms the one based on the biomedical lexicon as a source of terms, with an improvement of roughly 3\% for MAP. However, the query expansion method based on the biomedical lexicon is much less resource intensive since it does not require computation of any relevance feedback set or any initial execution of the query. Hence, in term of trade-off between efficiency, execution time and retrieval accuracy, we argue that the query expansion method based on the biomedical lexicon offers the best performance for a prototype biomedical data search engine intended to be used at a large scale. In the official bioCADDIE challenge results, although our approach is ranked seventh in terms of the infNDCG evaluation metric, it ranks second in term of P@10 and NDCG. Hence, the method proposed here provides overall good retrieval performance in relation to the approaches of other competitors. Consequently, the observations made in this paper should benefit the development of a Data Discovery Index prototype or the improvement of the existing one.},

Specifically, we demonstrate that the published literature associated with each data record can be used to automatically evaluate its quality, by cross-checking the consistency of the key content of the database record with the referenced publications. Focusing on GenBank, we describe a set of quality indicators based on the relevance paradigm of information retrieval (IR). Then, we use these quality indicators to train an anomaly detection algorithm to classify records as “confident” or “suspicious”. Our experiments on the PubMed Central collection show assessing the coherence between the literature and database records, through our algorithms, is an effective mechanism for assisting curators to perform data cleansing. Although fewer than 0.25% of the records in our data set are known to be faulty, we would expect that there are many more in GenBank that have not yet been identified. By automated comparison with literature they can be identified with a precision of up to 10% and a recall of up to 30%, while strongly outperforming several baselines. While these results leave substantial room for improvement, they reflect both the very imbalanced nature of the data, and the limited explicitly labelled data that is available. Overall, the obtained results show promise for the development of a new kind of approach to detecting low-quality and suspicious sequence records based on literature analysis and consistency. From a practical point of view, this will greatly help curators in identifying inconsistent records in large-scale sequence databases by highlighting records that are likely to be inconsistent with the literature.},

However, the sequence type attribute is generally a non-mandatory free-text field, and thus it is subject to many errors including typos, mis-assignment, and non-assignment. In GenBank, this problem concerns roughly 18\% of records, an alarming number that should worry the biocuration community. To address this problem of automatic sequence type classification, we propose the use of literature associated to sequence records as an external source of knowledge that can be leveraged for the classification task. We define a set of literature-based features and train a machine learning algorithm to classify a record into one of six primary sequence types. The main intuition behind using the literature for this task is that sequences appear to be discussed differently in scientific articles, depending on their type. The experiments we have conducted on the PubMed Central collection show that the literature is indeed an effective way to address this problem of sequence type classification. Our classification method reached an accuracy of 92.7\%, and substantially outperformed two baseline approaches used for comparison.},

While recent work has suggested that variations on standard classifiers can be effectively trained as topical filters (Lin, Snow, and Morgan 2011; Yang et al. 2014; Magdy and Elsayed 2014), there remain many open questions about the efficacy of such classification-based filtering approaches. For example, over a year or more after training, how well do such classifiers generalize to future novel topical content, and are such results stable across a range of topics? Furthermore, what features and feature classes are most critical for long-term classifier performance? To answer these questions, we collected a corpus of over 800 million English Tweets via the Twitter streaming API during 2013 and 2014 and learned topic classifiers for 10 diverse themes ranging from social issues to celebrity deaths to the “Iran nuclear deal”. The results of this long-term study of topic classifier performance provide a number of important insights, among them that (1) such classifiers can indeed generalize to novel topical content with high precision over a year or more after training and (2) simple terms and locations are the most informative feature classes (despite training on classes labeled via hashtags). &lt;/p&gt;},

	abstract     = {Bioinformatics sequence databases such as Genbank or UniProt contain hundreds of millions of records of genomic data. These records are derived from direct submissions from individual laboratories, as well as from bulk submissions from large-scale sequencing centres; their diversity and scale means that they suffer from a range of data quality issues including errors, discrepancies, redundancies, ambiguities, incompleteness and inconsistencies with the published literature. In this work, we seek to investigate and analyze the data quality of sequence databases from the perspective of a curator, who must detect anomalous and suspicious records. Specifically, we emphasize the detection of inconsistent records with respect to the literature. Focusing on GenBank, we propose a set of 24 quality indicators, which are based on treating a record as a query into the published literature, and then use query quality predictors. We then carry out an analysis that shows that the proposed quality indicators and the quality of the records have a mutual relationship, in which one depends on the other. We propose to represent record-literature consistency as a vector of these quality indicators. By reducing the dimensionality of this representation for visualization purposes using principal component analysis, we show that records which have been reported as inconsistent with the literature fall roughly in the same area, and therefore share similar characteristics. By manually analyzing records not previously known to be erroneous that fall in the same area than records know to be inconsistent, we show that one record out of four is inconsistent with respect to the literature. This high density of inconsistent record opens the way towards the development of automatic methods for the detection of faulty records. We conclude that literature inconsistency is a meaningful strategy for identifying suspicious records.Database URL: https://github.com/rbouadjenek/DQBioinformatics},

	abstract     = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most commonly used recommendation methods. CF consists in predicting whether, or how much, a user will like (or dislike) an item by leveraging the knowledge of the user’s preferences as well as that of other users. In practice, users interact and express their opinion on only a small subset of items, which makes the corresponding user-item rating matrix very sparse. Such data sparsity yields two main problems for recommender systems: (1) the lack of data to effectively model users’ preferences, and (2) the lack of data to effectively model item characteristics. However, there are often many other data sources that are available to a recommender system provider, which can describe user interests and item characteristics (e.g., users’ social network, tags associated to items, etc.). These valuable data sources may supply useful information to enhance a recommendation system in modeling users’ preferences and item characteristics more accurately and thus, hopefully, to make recommenders more precise. For various reasons, these data sources may be managed by clusters of different data centers, thus requiring the development of distributed solutions. In this paper, we propose a new distributed collaborative filtering algorithm, which exploits and combines multiple and diverse data sources to improve recommendation quality. Our experimental evaluation using real datasets shows the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.},

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by an intensive evaluation on three large public datasets crawled from delicious, Flickr, and CiteULike. We show that the expanded queries built by our method provide more accurate results as compared to the initial queries, by increasing the MAP in a range of 10 to 16{\%} on the three datasets. We also compare our method to three state of the art baselines, and we show that our query expansion method allows significant improvement in the MAP, with a boost in a range between 5 to 18{\%}.},

	abstract     = {Geo-temporal visualization of Twitter search results is a challenging task since the simultaneous display of all matching tweets would result in a saturated and unreadable display. In such settings, clustering search results can assist users to scan only a few coherent groups of related tweets rather than many individual tweets. However, in practice, the use of unsupervised clustering methods such as K -Means does not necessarily guarantee that the clusters themselves are relevant. Therefore, we develop a novel method of relevance-driven clustering for visual information retrieval to supply users with highly relevant clusters representing different information perspectives of their queries. We specifically propose a Visual Twitter Information Retrieval (Viz-TIR) tool for relevance-driven clustering and ranking of Twitter search results. At the heart of Viz-TIR is a fast greedy algorithm that optimizes an approximation of an expected F1-Score metric to generate these clusters. We demonstrate its effectiveness w.r.t. K -Means and a baseline method that shows all top matching results on a scenario related to searching natural disasters in US-based Twitter data spanning 2013 and 2014. Our demo shows that Viz-TIR is easy to use and more precise in extracting geo-temporally coherent clusters given search queries in comparison to K-Means, thus aiding the user in visually searching and browsing social network content. Overall, we believe this work enables new opportunities for the synthesis of information retrieval as well as combined relevance and display-aware optimization techniques to support query-adaptive visual information exploration interfaces.},

	abstract     = {Abstract Supervised topic classifiers for Twitter and other media sources are important in a variety of long-term topic tracking tasks. Unfortunately, over long periods of time, features that are predictive during the training period may prove ephemeral and fail to generalize to prediction at future times. For example, if we trained a classifier to identify tweets concerning the topic of “Celebrity Death”, individual celebrity names and terms associated with these celebrities such as “Nelson Mandela” or “South Africa” would prove to be temporally unstable since they would not generalize over long periods of time; in contrast, terms like “RIP” (rest in peace) would prove to be temporally stable predictors of this topic over long periods of time. In this paper, we aim to design supervised learning methods for Twitter topic classifiers that are capable of automatically downweighting temporally unstable features to improve future generalization. To do this, we first begin with an oracular approach that chooses temporally stable features based on knowledge of both train and test data labels. We then search for feature metrics evaluated on only the training data that are capable of recovering the temporally stable features identified by our oracular definition. We next embed the top-performing metric as a temporal stability regularizer in logistic regression with the important property that the overall training objective retains convexity, hence enabling a globally optimal solution. Finally, we train our topic classifiers on 6 Twitter topics over roughly one year of data and evaluate on the following year of data, showing that logistic regression with our temporal stability regularizer generally outperforms logistic regression without such regularization across the full precision-recall continuum. Overall, these results establish a novel regularizer for training long-term temporally stable topic classifiers for Twitter and beyond.},

Explicitly modeling a latent distribution over user preferences allows VAEs to learn user and item representations that not only reproduce observed interactions, but also generalize them by leveraging learning from similar users and items. Unfortunately, VAE-CF can exhibit suboptimal learning properties; e.g., VAE-CFs will increase their prediction confidence as they receive more preferences per user, even when those preferences may vary widely and create ambiguity in the user representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Queryable Variational Autoencoder (Q-VAE) variant of the VAE that explicitly models arbitrary conditional relationships between observations. The proposed model appropriately increases uncertainty (rather than reduces it) in cases where a large number of user preferences may lead to an ambiguous user representation. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the Q-VAE generally performs comparably or outperforms VAE-based recommenders as well as other state-of-the-art approaches and is generally competitive across the user preference density spectrum, where other methods peak for certain preference density levels.},

	abstract     = {Background The ability to predict readmission accurately after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is limited in current statistical models. Machine-learning (ML) methods have shown improved predictive ability in various clinical contexts, but their utility in predicting readmission after hospitalization for AMI is unknown. Methods Using detailed clinical information collected from patients hospitalized with AMI, we evaluated 6 ML algorithms (logistic regression, naïve Bayes, support vector machines, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep neural networks) to predict readmission within 30 days and 1 year of discharge. A nested cross-validation approach was used to develop and test models. We used C-statistics to compare discriminatory capacity, whereas the Brier score was used to indicate overall model performance. Model calibration was assessed using calibration plots. Results The 30-day readmission rate was 16.3%, whereas the 1-year readmission rate was 45.1%. For 30-day readmission, the discriminative ability for the ML models was modest (C-statistic 0.641; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.621-0.662 for gradient boosting) and did not outperform previously reported methods. For 1-year readmission, different ML models showed moderate performance, with C-statistics around 0.72. Despite modest discriminatory capabilities, the observed readmission rates were markedly higher in the tenth decile of predicted risk compared with the first decile of predicted risk for both 30-day and 1-year readmission. Conclusions Despite including detailed clinical information and evaluating various ML methods, these models did not have better discriminatory ability to predict readmission outcomes compared with previously reported methods. Résumé Contexte Les modèles statistiques actuels ne permettent pas de prédire avec exactitude la réadmission après une hospitalisation pour cause d’infarctus aigu du myocarde (IAM). Les méthodes de prédiction faisant appel à l’apprentissage automatique ont été associées à une amélioration de la capacité de prédiction dans divers contextes cliniques, mais leur utilité pour prédire la réadmission après une hospitalisation pour cause d’IAM demeure inconnue. Méthodologie À l’aide de données cliniques détaillées recueillies auprès de patients hospitalisés pour un IAM, nous avons évalué six algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique (régression logistique, classification naïve bayésienne, machine à vecteurs de support, forêt aléatoire, boosting par descente de gradient fonctionnelle et réseaux neuronaux d’apprentissage profond) pour prédire la réadmission dans les 30 jours et dans l’année suivant la sortie de l’hôpital. Les modèles ont été mis au point et testés à l’aide d’une approche de validation croisée imbriquée. Nous avons utilisé la statistique C pour comparer la capacité de discrimination des différents modèles, et le score de Brier pour en chiffrer le rendement global. Le calage des modèles a été évalué au moyen de courbes d’étalonnage. Résultats Le taux de réadmission à 30 jours était de 16,3 %, tandis que le taux de réadmission à 1 an était de 45,1 %. Dans le cas de la réadmission à 30 jours, la capacité de discrimination des modèles d’apprentissage automatique était modeste (statistique C : 0,641; intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 % : 0,621-0,662 pour le boosting par descente de gradient fonctionnelle) et n’était pas supérieure à celle des méthodes déjà utilisées. Dans le cas de la réadmission à 1 an, différents modèles d’apprentissage automatique se sont révélés modérément efficaces, la statistique C se chiffrant à environ 0,72. En dépit des modestes capacités de discrimination des différentes méthodes, les taux de réadmission observés étaient nettement plus élevés dans le dixième décile du risque prédit comparativement à ceux du premier décile, pour la réadmission à 30 jours comme pour la réadmission à 1 an. Conclusions Malgré le recours à des données cliniques détaillées et à différentes méthodes d’apprentissage automatique, les modèles évalués n’ont pas montré une capacité de discrimination supérieure à celle des méthodes déjà utilisées pour prédire la réadmission.},

This suggests the need to aggregate results via a clustering method. However, standard unsupervised clustering algorithms like K-means (i) ignore relevance scores that can help with the extraction of highly relevant clusters, and (ii) do not necessarily optimize search results for purposes of visual presentation. In this article, we address both deficiencies by framing the clustering problem for search-driven user interfaces in a novel optimization framework that (i) aims to maximize the relevance of aggregated content according to cluster-based extensions of standard information retrieval metrics and (ii) defines clusters via constraints that naturally reflect interface-driven desiderata of spatial, temporal, and keyword coherence that do not require complex ad-hoc distance metric specifications as in K-means. After comparatively benchmarking algorithmic variants of our proposed approach – RadiCAL – in offline experiments, we undertake a user study with 24 subjects to evaluate whether RadiCAL improves human performance on visual search tasks in comparison to K-means clustering and a filtered search baseline. Our results show that (a) our binary partitioning search (BPS) variant of RadiCAL is fast, near-optimal, and extracts higher-relevance clusters than K-means, and (b) clusters optimized via RadiCAL result in faster search task completion with higher accuracy while requiring a minimum workload leading to high effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction among alternatives.},

	abstract     = {Combining symbolic human knowledge with neural networks provides a rule-based ante-hoc explanation of the output. In this paper, we propose feature extracting functions for integrating human knowledge abstracted as logic rules into the predictive behaviour of a neural network. These functions are embodied as programming functions, which represent the applicable domain knowledge as a set of logical instructions and provide a modified distribution of independent features on input data. Unlike other existing neural logic approaches, the programmatic nature of these functions implies that they do not require any kind of special mathematical encoding, which makes our method very general and flexible in nature. We illustrate the performance of our approach for sentiment classification and compare our results to those obtained using two baselines.},

	abstract     = {Standardized approaches to relevance classification in information retrieval use generative statistical models to identify the presence or absence of certain topics that might make a document relevant to the searcher. These approaches have been used to better predict relevance on the basis of what the document is “about”, rather than a simple-minded analysis of the bag of words contained within the document. In more recent times, this idea has been extended by using pre-trained deep learning models and text representations, such as GloVe or BERT. These use an external corpus as a knowledge-base that conditions the model to help predict what a document is about. This paper adopts a hybrid approach that leverages the structure of knowledge embedded in a corpus. In particular, the paper reports on experiments where linked data triples (subject-predicate-object), constructed from natural language elements are derived from deep learning. These are evaluated as additional latent semantic features for a relevant document classifier in a customized news-feed website. The research is a synthesis of current thinking in deep learning models in NLP and information retrieval and the predicate structure used in semantic web research. Our experiments indicate that linked data triples increased the F-score of the baseline GloVe representations by 6% and show significant improvement over state-of-the art models, like BERT. The findings are tested and empirically validated on an experimental dataset and on two standardized pre-classified news sources, namely the Reuters and 20 News groups datasets.},

	abstract     = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) also named COVID-19, aggressively spread all over the world in just a few months. Since then, it has multiple variants that are far more contagious than its parent. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 and its variants are crucial for its treatment, analysis of lungs damage and quarantine management. Deep learning-based solution for efficient and accurate diagnosis to COVID-19 and its variants using Chest X-rays, and computed tomography images could help to counter its outbreak. This work presents a novel depth-wise residual network with an atrous mechanism for accurate segmentation and lesion location of COVID-19 affected areas using volumetric CT images. The proposed framework consists of 3D depth-wise and 3D residual squeeze and excitation block in cascaded and parallel to capture uniformly multi-scale context (low-level detailed, mid-level comprehensive and high-level rich semantic features). The squeeze and excitation block adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling inter-dependencies between various channels. We further have introduced an atrous mechanism with a different atrous rate as the bottom layer. Extensive experiments on benchmark CT datasets showed considerable gain (5%) for accurate segmentation and lesion location of COVID-19 affected areas.},

	abstract     = {A number of recent works have made seminal contributions to the understanding of user intent and recommender interaction in conversational recommendation. However, to date, these studies have not focused explicitly on context-driven interaction that underlies the typical use of more pervasive Question Answering (QA) focused conversational assistants like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant. In this paper, we aim to understand a general workflow of natural context-driven conversational recommendation that arises from a pairwise study of a human user interacting with a human simulating the role of a recommender. In our analysis of this intrinsically organic human-to-human conversation, we observe a clear structure of interaction workflow consisting of a preference elicitation and refinement stage, followed by inquiry and critiquing stages after the first recommendation. To better understand the nature of these stages and the conversational flow within them, we augment existing taxonomies of intent and action to label all interactions at each stage and analyze the workflow. From this analysis, we identify distinct conversational characteristics of each stage, e.g., (i) the preference elicitation stage consists of significant iteration to clarify, refine, and obtain a mutual understanding of preferences, (ii) the inquiry and critiquing stage consists of extensive informational queries to understand features of the recommended item and to (implicitly) specify critiques, and (iii) explanation appears to drive a substantial portion of the post-recommendation interaction, suggesting that beyond the purpose of justification, explanation serves a critical role to direct the evolving conversation itself. Altogether, we contribute a novel qualitative and quantitative analysis of workflow in conversational recommendation that further refines our existing understanding of this important frontier of conversational systems and suggests a number of critical avenues for further research to better automate natural recommendation conversations.},
